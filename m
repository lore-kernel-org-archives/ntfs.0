Christian,

thanks for looking into this. I agree with a lot of the points you are
making. This message is still difficult to reply to because it
conflates multiple problems.

Agreed, do_withdraw() shouldn't set SB_RDONLY.

So when gfs2_thaw_super() is called on a withdrawn filesystem, it
should still call thaw_super(). Fair enough.

According to commit d564053f0746 ("GFS2: Clean up freeze code"), the
idea of the freeze sysfs file was to make it behave like the FIFREEZE
/ FITHAW ioctls. This isn't what the code is doing at all.

Yes, do_withdraw() shouldn't set SB_RDONLY.

Okay, (1) and (2) are related to the SB_RDONLY change.

And (3) and (4) are related to thawing a withdrawn filesystem.

Not sure what should prevent us from fixing withdrawn filesystem
thawing and the SB_RDONLY issue in separate commits. Both need fixing
in the end, but that's okay.

So before this patch, 'mount -o remount,rw' of a withdrawn filesystem
fails with -EIO, and this patch changes it to -EROFS. What's wrong
with -EIO? Once do_withdraw() doesn't set SB_RDONLY anymore, the
filesystem will remain read-write mounted; getting an -EROFS error in
that state seems odd.

Alright.

This is racy; the filesystem can still be withdrawn after this
gfs2_withdrawn() check. It should make more sense to bail out of the
for loop in gfs2_freeze_super() on withdrawn filesystems.

I'm not a fan of those fake mount options. It doesn't matter all that
much for "withdrawn" because remounting will fail anyway, but it's
still messy.

Filesystems with "demote_interface_used" can be remounted, so that
fake option is worse.

"demote_rq" and "demote_interface_used" should never have been added
in the first place, but here we are.
